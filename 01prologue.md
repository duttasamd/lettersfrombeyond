PROLOGUE

The best way to start something new is to jump right into it instead of planning too much. That is the biggest lesson that life has taught me. Planning is important, but people like me, who like to plan every little detail, often get stuck at the planning phase. The plan is never perfect enough. And, it can’t ever be. You can’t know all the challenges form the outside, so the plans will always be, at best, hollow. We never feel comfortable enough to take the first step. That is the hardest part of any task. The first step. 

In all cases where your life _does not_ hang in the balance, the planning phase belongs _after_ the first step; not _before_. I have had these sudden cravings of writing my thoughts down, all my life but I always wanted it to be perfect and wanted to plan exactly what I would write, plan an entire book before I even wrote a single word. And that has gotten me nowhere. I am trying to change that. Change myself. Take the first step. Everything is a bit easier after that.

*Life is happening too fast to me these days.* 
Have you ever walked down a busy street, when all the noise, the lights and the activities drown your mind in a constant static but you don’t actually register a thing and kind of zone out? That’s been my last 2 years. And the crazy dreams. Lately I have exclusively been dreaming about death or dead people. I would wake up in the middle of the night, paralysed, seating and stay up for an hour, thinking, too scared to sleep again. But these vivid dreams have the distinct advantage of lighting up your brain like it’s Christmas. And you start getting these out-there ideas.

Life has 2 parts. The Above and the Beyond, and we right now, right here act as a permeative membrane. We can see what’s coming from above, take steps, act on it as it passes through us and goes into the beyond, where it is beyond our reach and only exists as fading memories. Untouchable. But always there, always fading. Triggered by trivial things like the smell of a flower or a silly old song, they sometimes come back like a warm flood and lift you up, or like a cold current pegging you down. If we are collection of all the things that have happened to us, then memories are the best representation of our identity. So, I set out to document some of my fading flailing memories as and when they come to me in these letters from beyond.
